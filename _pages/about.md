I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Brock University. 

I graduated with a PhD in Statistics from Simon Fraser University in 2020 under the supervision of Dr. Jiguo Cao. I received my MSc in Actuarial Science from Simon Fraser University in 2014 and I completed my BSc in Statistics from Jilin University in 2011.

My research interests include sports analytics, machine learning, functional data analysis, and nonparametric statistics. 

I enjoy watching sports (basketball, soccer, baseball, skating, snooker, poker, and a lot more). I also enjoy reading, hiking, and traveling.
